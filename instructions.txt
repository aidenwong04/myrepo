First I created a repository on GitHub and cloned it into my terminal using a SSH key. 

Then I learned how to track changes using git, how to add, commit, and push to the remote repository. 

I then learned how to create a new branch on the cloned repository, how to modify it, and how to commit branch changes. After that, I also learned how to squash multiple commits into one commit. 

Finally, I learned how to create a pull request, and sync my repository with the upstream.
